abstract="A software supply chain attack is characterized by the injection of malicious code into a software package in order to compromise dependent systems further down the chain. Recent years saw a number of supply chain attacks that leverage the increasing use of open source during software development, which is facilitated by dependency managers that automatically resolve, download and install hundreds of open source packages throughout the software life cycle. Even though many approaches for detection and discovery of vulnerable packages exist, no prior work has focused on malicious packages. This paper presents a dataset as well as analysis of 174 malicious software packages that were used in real-world attacks on open source software supply chains and which were distributed via the popular package repositories npm, PyPI, and RubyGems. Those packages, dating from November 2015 to November 2019, were manually collected and analyzed. This work is meant to facilitate the future development of preventive and detective safeguards by open source and research communities.",

Navy Electronics Laboratory, San Diego, California, as a “bootstrap” compiler for the Remington Rand Univac COUNTESS computer. This compiler was used to generate a version of itself which, running as a COUNTESS program, generated machine code for the Control Data Corporation CDC-1604 computer. This second compiler was then used to generate a version of NELIAC for the CDC-1604. All three versions of NELIAC accepted essentially identical input language.},

abstract = {Abstract. Software development in the FreeBSD project is incremental in the sense that a stream of contributions, including bugfixes and minor and major new features, go into a single branch in the repository, the development branch (or ‘trunk’), and are required to preserve the software in a working state. This creates a succession of development releases, akin to the practice of frequent releasing argued by Eric S. Raymond in his essay ‘The Cathedral and the Bazaar’ to be the key to the success of Linux and other open source projects. The positive and negative impact of this approach is discussed based on a survey involving 72 project participants. On the positive side, the data indicate that it creates a highly motivating ‘see bug, fix bug, see bug fixed in new release’ life cycle, and helps integrate bugfixing with new development. On the negative side, the data indicates that the highly incremental model does not support the development of complex new features.},
