abstract = {An implementation of translators between Ada and Pascal is described. The method used is to define subsets of each language between which there is a straightforward translation and to translate each source program to its respective sublanguage by program transformations. A common internal tree representation is used. The underlying organization of the translators is described, and some of the difficulties we have confronted and solves are discussed.},
